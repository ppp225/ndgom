# Why

Coz it's fun.

Just look at the name alone. This builds on ndgo and aims to give orm like experience, but for graph db! Let's break it down:
* `g` stands for graph
* `dg` stands for [dgraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io), the graph database
* `go` stands for [The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/)
* `dgo` stands for [dgo](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgo) - the Dgraph Go client
* `ndgo` stands for [ndgo](https://github.com/ppp225/ndgo) - iterates on dgo adding low-abstraction abstractions
* `m` - as in map/mapper - adds mappings
* `om` - object mappings?
* `gom` - graph object mapping (as opposed to orm). Why not ogm? Because it would be too similar in name to [dgogm](https://github.com/akshaydeo/dgogm) and would add 2 characters instead of one to the name, that would be inefficient!
* `ndgom` - all of the above.

Isn't it fun?
