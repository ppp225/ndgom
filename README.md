# ndgom [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ppp225/mdgom?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/ppp225/ndgom)   

WIP

ndgom builds on [ndgo](https://github.com/ppp225/ndgo) and aims to give orm like experience for [dgraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io) graph db

# Why

Coz it's fun.

Just look at the name alone. Let's break it down:
* `  g  ` - graph
* ` dg  ` - [dgraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io), the graph database
* `  go ` - [The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/)
* ` dgo ` - [dgo](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgo) - the Dgraph Go client
* `ndgo ` - [ndgo](https://github.com/ppp225/ndgo) - iterates on dgo adding low-abstraction abstractions
* `    m` - as in map/mapper - adds mappings
* `   om` - object mappings?
* `  gom` - graph object mapping (as opposed to orm). Why not ogm? Because it would be too similar in name to [dgogm](https://github.com/akshaydeo/dgogm) and would add 2 characters instead of one to the name, that would be inefficient!
* `    m` - magic! Initially, I planned ndgo to have an ndgo.Magic{} helper, but decided to keep it simple there - all the magic will happen here.
* `ndgom` - all of the above.

Isn't it fun?
